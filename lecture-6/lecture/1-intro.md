# Graphs

## Real world use cases

- Facebook's social network - Graph API

- Google maps
    - Intersections: nodes
    - Roads: edges

## How do you represent graphs in a machine?

- adjacency matrix
    - matrix of 0/1 (or weights)
- adjacency list
    - person a: 50 friends
    - person b: 100 friends

## Problems in interviews

- traverals: depth first search (DFS) & breadth first search (BFS)

- number of islands
- shortest path from point a to point b
